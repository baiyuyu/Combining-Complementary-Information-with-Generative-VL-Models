## Abstract

Our work explores the integration of multimodal data using diverse models. This repository provides scripts used for analyzing results, enabling replication of the findings and further exploration.

---

## Features

- Scripts for data analysis, visualization, and model evaluation.
- Reproducible analysis for the experiments discussed in the paper.
- Modular codebase for easy adaptation to other multimodal datasets and models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.8
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn`
  - [Other libraries, e.g., `scikit-learn`, if applicable]

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/repo_name.git
cd repo_name
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Data Preparation
Download the dataset(s) from [source link].
Place the dataset(s) in the data/ directory.
Use the preprocessing script:

python preprocess.py --input_dir data/raw --output_dir data/processed

### Running the Scripts
1. Analyze Results
Run the analysis script to process and evaluate results:
